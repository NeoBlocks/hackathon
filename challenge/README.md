 ## What are we building?
 
Create a secure messenger with the focus on privacy. Current popular messenging services are highly centralized. The world depends on services like WhatsApp, Facebook or Google. By using a service like WhatsApp you share your contacts with Facebook who can use this data to track and profile their users. Think about the problems we need to solve to create a fully decentralized, highly secure and private way of messaging each other without compromising the usability of a service like WhatsApp. Use a decentralized smart contract to store any information that is needed for the application to work.
